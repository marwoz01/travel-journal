# My Travel Journal

A simple React project presenting a travel journal in the form of reusable cards.

## About the project
The application displays visited places (such as Mount Fuji, Sydney Opera House, and Geirangerfjord) based on an array of data and renders them as reusable card components.

## What I learned
- Why **component reusability** is important in React  
- How to pass data using **props**  
- How to **create components from an array of data** using `map()`

## Technologies
- React  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS
